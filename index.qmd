# Introduction {#introduction}

Dygraphs is an open-source Javascript charting library that is designed for interactive visualization of large time-series datasets. It enables real-time data analysis, allowing users to hover over graphs to view precise data points. Dygraphs supports multiple data series, making it useful for comparing trends over time. It supports real-time updates, zooming and panning. Additionally, it supports CSV and JSON formats, making it easy to integrate with various data sources.

# Installation and Setup {#installation-and-setup}

Dygraphs is easy to use and requires minimal setup. 

## Including Dygraphs In Your Project

There are multiple ways to include Dygraphs in your project.

### Using a Content Delivery Network (CDN)

A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of distributed servers that deliver web content (e.g., JavaScript, CSS etc.) from the closest servers to users, improving load speed and performance. CDNs help handle high traffic efficiently. [UNPKG](https://unpkg.com) is a CDN that hosts dygraphs.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/dygraphs@2.2.1/dist/dygraph.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://unpkg.com/dygraphs@2.2.1/dist/dygraph.min.css" />
```

Include this code inside the `<head>` section of an HTML page to use Dygraphs.

### Installing via npm

If you are using a JavaScript framework, install Dygraphs using npm.

```sh
npm install dygraphs
```

Then, import it into your JavaScript file.

```js
import Dygraph from "dygraphs";
```

## Verifying Installation

In order to confirm whether Dygraphs has been loaded successfully or not, run the following command:

```js
console.log(typeof Dygraph); 
// Expected output: "function"
```

If you are using an HTML file, include this as part of the `<script>` section of the `<body>` section. If you are using a Javascript file, add this command to the file containing the import.

Once you have included Dygraphs into your project, you can use it directly.
